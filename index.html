        Hi, welcome to the show. You're late. <br><br>
        This text is clickable somewhere, but first you have to read it.
        It is quite important that you understand the dynamics of this show before you gain access to the first stage.
        So, once you're next to the virtual stage (not on it; only one person belongs there), you will be confronted by two digital elements: 1) a moving image and 2) a textual trailer. 
        I assume that the concept of a moving image triggers different sensations for different people, therefore I intend not to (over)explain what it symbolizes in this context. *eyes rolling, I know*
        In fact, I won't explain it at all. But the textual trailers are important; not as much in the message they aim to excite as in the function they carry. That's because of their clickable nature. They give access to the next stage. 
        When you're done reading this, click
        <a href="pages/show0.html">me.</a>
